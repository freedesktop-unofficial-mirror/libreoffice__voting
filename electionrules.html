	to be filled during this election.</P>

	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Members of the GNOME
	Foundation as of November 8, 2001 are eligible to vote in the
	election.  Anyone who has made a contribution to GNOME can
	apply for membership by completing the <a href="http://foundation.gnome.org/membership-form.html">application</a>.

	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">All candidates should mail a
	summary of their candicacy announcement (see previous rule) to
	elections@gnome.org.  Summaries should be no more than 75
	words of continuous text (i.e. no bullet lists or multiple
	paragraphs) and must be received by the nomination deadline
	given above.  A compilation of the summaries will be mailed to
	all registered voters several days prior to the election.</LI>

	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">All discussion related to
	the election should be held on foundation-list@gnome.org.
	Members are invited to ask questions of one or all candidates
	on that list.</P>

	receive the most votes will be elected, except that no more
	than four individuals affiliated with any one corporation may

	vote-getters be affiliated with the same company, only the
	four with the most votes will be considered elected.  For a
	full definition of corporate affiliation, see the GNOME
	Foundation Charter.</P>

	results by e-mailing elections@gnome.org prior to November 27,
