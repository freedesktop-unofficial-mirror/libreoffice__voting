Your LibreOffice 2013 Conference Location Poll Voting Token

Dear $member,

The poll for the LibreOffice 2013 conference location will soon be
open.

Voting will run from 2013-01-16 (Wednesday) until 2013-02-04, 23:59 UTC.

To vote, please go to

 https://elections.documentfoundation.org/vote.php?election_id=4

and follow the instructions there.

A list of candidates and their statements are available at
https://elections.documentfoundation.org/2013-confpoll/candidates.html

When instructed to do so, enter the following details:

   E-mail: $email
   Vote token: $token

The election has 4 steps - first, you must identify yourself using the
voting token above. Then select your preferred candidate (you can
choose at most one). A third step will show you your choice, and ask
you to confirm or return to the previous step. Finally, after
confirming your choice, a unique identifier will be given to you which
will allow you to verify after the poll that your vote was counted
correctly. To ensure anonymity, no link will be kept between this
token and your identifiers, so please keep this token safe. Once you
have voted, you will not be able to vote again.

Thank you for your vote!

Regards,
  Thorsten Behrens
  on behalf of The Document Foundation Board of Directors
