Your LibreOffice 2012 Conference Location Poll Voting Token

Dear $member,

The poll for the LibreOffice 2012 conference location will soon be
open.

Voting will run from 2012-02-12 (Sunday) until 2012-02-19, 23:59 UTC.

To vote, please go to
https://elections.documentfoundation.org/vote.php?election_id=2
and follow the instructions there.

A list of candidates and their statements are available at
https://elections.documentfoundation.org/2012-confpoll/candidates.html

When instructed to do so, enter the following details:

   E-mail: $email
   Vote token: $token

The election has 4 steps - first, you must identify yourself using the 
voting token above. Then select your preferred candidate (you can only
choose one). A third step will show you your choice, and ask you to 
confirm or return to the previous step. Finally, after confirming your 
choice, a unique identifier will be given to you which will allow you to 
verify after the poll that your vote was counted correctly. To ensure 
anonymity, no link will be kept between this token and your identifiers, 
so please keep this token safe. Once you have voted, you will not be able 
to vote again.

Thank you for your vote!

Regards,
  Thorsten Behrens
  Deputy chair of the Board, on behalf of The Document Foundation
  Board of Directors
