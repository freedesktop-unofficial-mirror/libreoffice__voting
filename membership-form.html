<h3>GNOME Contributions</h3>
<p>Membership in the GNOME Foundation requires that the candidate has
contributed to a non-trivial improvement in the GNOME Project.  Please
use the following sections to explain how you have contributed to the
project, providing enough detail to allow the committee to verify your
application.</p>

<p>Please provide a short list of areas of GNOME to which you have
made a non-trivial contribution (for entry into the public membership list).  For example,
"Documentation, gnomecal, Debian packaging.":</p>
<textarea lines=2 cols=70 name="summary">
</textarea>

<p>Please provide a more detailed description of your contributions to
help the membership committee determine your eligibility.  In general,
anything listed above should be explained here, and additional
contributions can be included.  For example: "Wrote a chapter "How to
Use the GNOME Calendaring System" for the GNOME Users Guide.  Several
patches for gnomecal related to color support.  Packaged the 1.4
release for Debian.":</p>

<textarea rows=10 cols=70 name="details">
</textarea>

<p>Please list individuals (frequently, but not necessarily, project
maintainers) who can help the membership committee determine your
eligibility.  You should provide their name, e-mail address, and a
brief description of their role as a reference.  If there is nobody
you can think to list, feel free to suggest another way for the
committee to verify your contributions, such as a pointer to a project
ChangeLog, etc.  To continue the earlier example: "Dan Mueth
(d-mueth@uchicago.edu) (GDP coordinator); Russell Steinthal
(rms39@columbia.edu) (gnome-pim maintainer); packaging logs at
http://www.debian.org/packages/gnome/":</p>
