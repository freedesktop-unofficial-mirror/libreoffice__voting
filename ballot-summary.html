<H2>Candidates for Fall 2002 GNOME Foundation Elections</H2>
<!--<P>Nov 10, 2001</P>-->
<P><BR></P>
</center>

<P>Below you will find a list of candidates who are running for the
GNOME Foundation Board of Directors. A short summary statement from
each candidate and a link to their full candidacy announcement is
provided to help you learn more about them. We encourage all voters
to read the full candidacy statements and related discussions on
foundation-list@gnome.org
(<A HREF="http://mail.gnome.org/archives/foundation-list/">http://mail.gnome.org/archives/foundation-list/</A>).</P>
<P>When deciding who you should vote for, please carefully consider
the various tasks the Board of Directors must perform. This overview
(<A HREF="overview.html">http://foundation.gnome.org/overview.html</A>)
may be helpful. Keep in mind that the board will make a number of
important decisions and will also have to perform many tasks which
require a significant amount of time and effort and the ability to
work and communicate with other people, companies, and the media. The
board of directors will represent GNOME to companies and the world in
a very real way. It is a good idea to strive for a well-balanced
board consisting of people with various backgrounds, skills, and
perspectives.</P>
<P>Additional election details can be found at the end of this
message and on <A HREF="http://foundation.gnome.org">http://foundation.gnome.org</A>
(where you can also find this document).</P>

<P><B>CANDIDATES FOR THE GNOME FOUNDATION BOARD OF DIRECTORS</B> 
</P>

<P>1. MARTIN SAVIOR<br />
&quot;
Now that the push for corporate desktop is on in earnest I believe I can
help the GNOME community of volunteer hackers feel empowered by
providing a genuinely independent voice on the Board. I can do this
because I have no financial stake in any company. I contribute to
AbiWord and GNOME for the love of hacking and the desire to be part of
the project to make the World's best desktop.

</P>

<P>2. RICHARD STALLMAN<br />
&quot;
I've been working for GNOME since years before there was a GNOME.  In
1983, while formulating plans for the GNU operating system, I decided
it should include a window system.  After two desktop initiatives that
didn't pan out, I found Miguel, who launched our third desktop
project--GNOME.
<br />
As president of the Free Software Foundation and Chief GNUisance of
the GNU Project, I have had years of experience working with
contributors both individual and corporate.

</P>

<P>3. MIGUEL DE ICAZA<br />
&quot;
Have been an active contributor to the free software movement
since 1992.
<br />
Started the GNOME project when various freedom issues arised
that would threaten the future of a fully free system.  
<br />
I am one of the founders of Ximian, one of the GNOME
companies, where we employ around 40 GNOME hackers that
develop free software. 
<br />
Have been actively involved for the past year in the
development of Mono and the Gtk bindings for C#.
