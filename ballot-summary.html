<H2>Candidates for Fall 2002 GNOME Foundation Elections</H2>
<!--<P>Nov 10, 2001</P>-->
<P><BR></P>
</center>

<P>Below you will find a list of candidates who are running for the
GNOME Foundation Board of Directors. A short summary statement from
each candidate and a link to their full candidacy announcement is
provided to help you learn more about them. We encourage all voters
to read the full candidacy statements and related discussions on
foundation-list@gnome.org
(<A HREF="http://mail.gnome.org/archives/foundation-list/">http://mail.gnome.org/archives/foundation-list/</A>).</P>
<P>When deciding who you should vote for, please carefully consider
the various tasks the Board of Directors must perform. This overview
(<A HREF="overview.html">http://foundation.gnome.org/overview.html</A>)
may be helpful. Keep in mind that the board will make a number of
important decisions and will also have to perform many tasks which
require a significant amount of time and effort and the ability to
work and communicate with other people, companies, and the media. The
board of directors will represent GNOME to companies and the world in
a very real way. It is a good idea to strive for a well-balanced
board consisting of people with various backgrounds, skills, and
perspectives.</P>
<P>Additional election details can be found at the end of this
message and on <A HREF="http://foundation.gnome.org">http://foundation.gnome.org</A>

<P>1. MARTIN SEVIOR<br />
&quot;
Now that the push for corporate desktop is on in earnest I believe I can
help the GNOME community of volunteer hackers feel empowered by
providing a genuinely independent voice on the Board. I can do this
because I have no financial stake in any company. I contribute to
AbiWord and GNOME for the love of hacking and the desire to be part of
the project to make the World's best desktop.

<P>2. RICHARD STALLMAN<br />
&quot;
I've been working for GNOME since years before there was a GNOME.  In
1983, while formulating plans for the GNU operating system, I decided
it should include a window system.  After two desktop initiatives that
didn't pan out, I found Miguel, who launched our third desktop
project--GNOME.
<br />
As president of the Free Software Foundation and Chief GNUisance of
the GNU Project, I have had years of experience working with
contributors both individual and corporate.

</P>

<P>3. MIGUEL DE ICAZA<br />
&quot;
Have been an active contributor to the free software movement
since 1992.
<br />
Started the GNOME project when various freedom issues arised
that would threaten the future of a fully free system.  
<br />
I am one of the founders of Ximian, one of the GNOME
companies, where we employ around 40 GNOME hackers that
develop free software. 
<br />
Have been actively involved for the past year in the
development of Mono and the Gtk bindings for C#.

<P>4. BILL HANEMAN<br />
&quot;
I am active not only in the accessibility project work, 
but also am actively working with the groups doing Mozilla, 
OpenOffice, and Java integration with GNOME.  My goals for GNOME:
a great developer platform, a complete user desktop environment
that is not only free but fully accessible to everyone.  
I am a also Sun Microsystems employee, but would serve as an 
"individual contributor" and always keep the "big picture" for GNOME
paramount.

</P>

<P>5. MIKE NEWMAN<br />
&quot;
I'm standing as an independant, experienced committee worker with the
international and democratic interests of GNOME as my prime concerns,
along with transparent and accessible board activity. Having been
involved in GNOME for two years working with the membership committee,
and with a great deal of experience in similar roles I feel I have a
wide view of GNOME's goals and the capabilities and time to serve as an
effective board member.

<P>6. GLYNN FOSTER<br />
&quot;
I do GNOME hacking at Sun. I don't do celery. I do motivation 
and energy. I don't do philosophy, politics or vegemite. I do
random documentation. I don't do cucumber. I do weekly release 
team meetings. I don't do toilet cleaning. I do climbing and beer. 
I don't do chewing gum. I do opinions, sleep and campus boards. I 
don't do veruccas. I do mobile phones badly. I don't do cocktails 
and hard liquor.

</P>

<P>7. BASTIEN NOCERA<br />
&quot;
I've been a GNOME developer for more than 2 years now, starting as an
independant application developer, and finding myself more and more
involved in work on the core desktop.
<br />
I have never before been part of such a board, but I understand the
requisites for such a position, and will do everything to represent
the people voting for me.

</P>

<P>8. MALCOLM TREDINNICK<br />
&quot;
Have done a reasonable amount of API documentation, along with writing a few
standalone documents aimed at helping developers use GNOME more easily. I am
interested in seeing GNOME be pitched as viable desktop platform to developers
and would like to see more events such as Sun's developer courses and the
tutorials planned for next year's GUADEC. Experience serving on committees
both at state and national level.

</P>

<P>9. MICHAEL MEEKS<br />
&quot;
- Pushing for closer integration with other parts of the desktop;
OpenOffice particularly.
<br />
- Ensuring that Gnome stays a Meritocracy
<br />
- Keeping our vision wider than a file manager and control panel, and
on a complete Free software desktop.
<br />
- Ensuring the hackers make the coding / code inclusion decisions, the
artists make the art / art inclusion decisions, the UI team decide
the UI, the i18n team in charge of i18n, and the release team
co-ordinating releases.

<P>10. DANIEL VEILLARD<br />
&quot;
I am French, long time Gnomer and Linux addict, maintainer of
libxml, libxslt and rpmfind. I served on the Gnome Board for two
years and I am used to non-profit organizations and the negociations
needed to reach consensus in a group. I will focuse on the reuse
of standards, internationalization and keeping trust relationship at an
individual level. I think those are needed to keep hacking on Gnome fun
and getting acceptance in new communities. Growing the foundation to
get acceptance by program developpers is the next challenge of the Board.

<P>11. JAMES HENSTRIDGE<br />
&quot;
I am an Australian GNOME hacker.  I have been working on the project 
since 1998, focussing on language bindings (I am maintainer of the 
Python bindings) and the platofrm libraries (I maintain libglade).  I am 
currently serving on the 2002 board.
