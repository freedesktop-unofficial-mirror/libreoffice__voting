<H2>Candidates for Fall 2002 GNOME Foundation Elections</H2>
<!--<P>Nov 10, 2001</P>-->
<P><BR></P>
</center>

<P>Below you will find a list of candidates who are running for the
GNOME Foundation Board of Directors. A short summary statement from
each candidate and a link to their full candidacy announcement is
provided to help you learn more about them. We encourage all voters
to read the full candidacy statements and related discussions on
foundation-list@gnome.org
(<A HREF="http://mail.gnome.org/archives/foundation-list/">http://mail.gnome.org/archives/foundation-list/</A>).</P>
<P>When deciding who you should vote for, please carefully consider
the various tasks the Board of Directors must perform. This overview
(<A HREF="overview.html">http://foundation.gnome.org/overview.html</A>)
may be helpful. Keep in mind that the board will make a number of
important decisions and will also have to perform many tasks which
require a significant amount of time and effort and the ability to
work and communicate with other people, companies, and the media. The
board of directors will represent GNOME to companies and the world in
a very real way. It is a good idea to strive for a well-balanced
board consisting of people with various backgrounds, skills, and
perspectives.</P>
<P>Additional election details can be found at the end of this
message and on <A HREF="http://foundation.gnome.org">http://foundation.gnome.org</A>
(where you can also find this document).</P>
<P>If you have any questions, please send them to either
