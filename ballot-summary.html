<H2>Candidates for Fall 2002 GNOME Foundation Elections</H2>
<!--<P>Nov 10, 2001</P>-->
<P><BR></P>
</center>

<P>Below you will find a list of candidates who are running for the
GNOME Foundation Board of Directors. A short summary statement from
each candidate and a link to their full candidacy announcement is
provided to help you learn more about them. We encourage all voters
to read the full candidacy statements and related discussions on
foundation-list@gnome.org
(<A HREF="http://mail.gnome.org/archives/foundation-list/">http://mail.gnome.org/archives/foundation-list/</A>).</P>
<P>When deciding who you should vote for, please carefully consider
the various tasks the Board of Directors must perform. This overview
(<A HREF="overview.html">http://foundation.gnome.org/overview.html</A>)
may be helpful. Keep in mind that the board will make a number of
important decisions and will also have to perform many tasks which
require a significant amount of time and effort and the ability to
work and communicate with other people, companies, and the media. The
board of directors will represent GNOME to companies and the world in
a very real way. It is a good idea to strive for a well-balanced
board consisting of people with various backgrounds, skills, and
perspectives.</P>

<P>1. MARTIN SEVIOR<br />
&quot;
Now that the push for corporate desktop is on in earnest I believe I can
help the GNOME community of volunteer hackers feel empowered by
providing a genuinely independent voice on the Board. I can do this
because I have no financial stake in any company. I contribute to
AbiWord and GNOME for the love of hacking and the desire to be part of
the project to make the World's best desktop.

&quot;
I've been working for GNOME since years before there was a GNOME.  In
1983, while formulating plans for the GNU operating system, I decided
it should include a window system.  After two desktop initiatives that
didn't pan out, I found Miguel, who launched our third desktop
project--GNOME.
<br />
As president of the Free Software Foundation and Chief GNUisance of
the GNU Project, I have had years of experience working with
contributors both individual and corporate.

&quot;
I am active not only in the accessibility project work, 
but also am actively working with the groups doing Mozilla, 
OpenOffice, and Java integration with GNOME.  My goals for GNOME:
a great developer platform, a complete user desktop environment
that is not only free but fully accessible to everyone.  
I am a also Sun Microsystems employee, but would serve as an 
"individual contributor" and always keep the "big picture" for GNOME
paramount.

I'm standing as an independant, experienced committee worker with the
international and democratic interests of GNOME as my prime concerns,
along with transparent and accessible board activity. Having been
involved in GNOME for two years working with the membership committee,

wide view of GNOME's goals and the capabilities and time to serve as an
effective board member.

- Pushing for closer integration with other parts of the desktop;
OpenOffice particularly.
<br />
- Ensuring that Gnome stays a Meritocracy
<br />
- Keeping our vision wider than a file manager and control panel, and
on a complete Free software desktop.
<br />
- Ensuring the hackers make the coding / code inclusion decisions, the
artists make the art / art inclusion decisions, the UI team decide
the UI, the i18n team in charge of i18n, and the release team
co-ordinating releases.

I am French, long time Gnomer and Linux addict, maintainer of
libxml, libxslt and rpmfind. I served on the Gnome Board for two
years and I am used to non-profit organizations and the negociations
needed to reach consensus in a group. I will focuse on the reuse
of standards, internationalization and keeping trust relationship at an
individual level. I think those are needed to keep hacking on Gnome fun
and getting acceptance in new communities. Growing the foundation to
get acceptance by program developpers is the next challenge of the Board.

I am passionate about GNOME and Free Software, and have committed a large

magic. This year my primary contribution to GNOME was leadership of the
Release Team to help our hackers pull off the amazing GNOME 2.0 release.
I will work to build upon GNOME's contributor base, maintain our casual,
personal community, ensure a transparently operated Foundation, and to
promote our project and achievements aggressively.

<P>13. JIM GETTYS<br />
&quot;
I'm announcing myself as a candidate for the 2002 elections of the
GNOME Foundation board of directors.
<br />
The largest value I bring to Gnome is one of perspective to the operation 
of a number of different styles of organizations. Specifically, GNOME 
needs to continue to be open to contributions of all sorts, whether code, 
or translations, or web work, to UI design and graphics, to name a few.
<br />
While I don't currently write Gnome code itself, I do hack on the X Window 
System, as I have for a long time; most recently on the RandR extension.  
I've been on the Gnome board the last two years.

<P>15. NAT FRIEDMAN<br />
&quot;
To date, the GNOME foundation has failed to be of any substantial
benefit to the GNOME project.  We are, however, reaching a level of
momentum and organization at which the foundation can have a big
impact.  What we lack is resources: funds to subsidize in-person events,
to fly people to conferences, to support our hardware and
infrastructural needs, to promote the project, and to provide equipment
to hackers who need it.  I served as co-chair of the board this last
year and organized the 90-person Boston GNOME Summit in July.  If
elected this year, my focus will be on ensuring that GNOME has the
resources it needs to succeed.

importantly, gfloppy.  I also do a number of sysadmin tasks, and help

&quot;
GNOME Foundation needs the combined efforts of hackers and non-hackers.
Since I first worked with GNOME four years ago, getting machines and
setting up booths and presentations, the developer community and user
base has grown tremendously.  
<br />
My contribution is to build bridges and obtain resources needed for
GNOME to successfully continue its growth. Working with the GNOME
community is a great experience and I'd like to continue pushing for
more adoption by governments and schools.

I want to get involved with the board for three reasons. First, to
improve communications between the board and /all/ volunteers,
including, but not just, hackers. Second, to increase the board's
activity level in areas where the board is GNOME's most effective organ,
like marketing, infrastructure, and fundraising. Finally, to ensure that
the board does not interfere with more direct community leadership in
areas where that leadership is already providing effective guidance.

<br />
I intend to establish better and more accessible usability standards in 
for the future of the GNOME desktop and related applications. I plan to do 
this by using my experience and expertise in the usability field, 
researching the way users do their jobs and providing that data to the 
hacker community, providing a forum for usability gurus and hackers to 
communicate, and helping said persons to organize themselves so a real 
review process can happen.

I've been hacking on GNOME almost since its early beginnings.  However,
about a year ago I took a longer break to concentrate more on
university.
<br />
This spring, I became a Mono hacker and since then, I've been hacking on
the compiler and the new Mono Debugger.
<br />
As an European guy and Mono hacker, my main focus is helping GNOME
moving forward in Europe and integrating GNOME and Mono nicely so that
people can quickly and easily design their coolest GNOME apps with Mono.

I'm running for the GNOME Foundation board in order to help GNOME and in
the process better myself by making GNOME problems, my problems.
While I'm not a serious coder I can code; I think my talents really lie in
facilitating and attacking problems from a high level.  I would like to
help the GNOME project grow further by encouraging the use of GEP, help
get documentation complete, and establish more desktop standards.  I've
had experience in leading a diverse engineering team, worked on projects
that spanned many physical locations, and had some management experience.
All of which requires critical thinking and planning.  Thanks.

&quot;
We lack complete developer's documentation for our 2.0 platform.  The
documentation I have written in the past has been useful to people, so I
want to work with the different developers of GNOME libraries to ensure
that their code has proper documentation.  Also, I want to help in
coordination between the GNOME and OpenOffice.org teams --- OO.o needs
to integrate well into the GNOME environment, and they may also be able
to use some of our cool technologies to avoid duplicated work.
