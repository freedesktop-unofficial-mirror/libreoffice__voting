NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Jan. 24, 2001-- RedFlag's Membership in the Foundation
Signals the Localization of GNOME Into Chinese -- Making it Available to More Than One
Billion People

<br><br>

In a move that will make GNOME available to more than a billion people, RedFlag has
joined the Advisory Board of the GNOME Foundation. As part of the membership, RedFlag
will lead an effort to localize GNOME, the entirely free user environment for desktops,
networked servers and portable Internet devices, into Simplified Chinese. "With the
addition of RedFlag and the localization of GNOME, businesses and individuals in China
can enjoy the power, cost-effectiveness and ease of use of free software," said Havoc
Pennington, GNOME Foundation board chair. "In addition, talented programmers in China
will be able to utilize the modern architecture and design of GNOME for application
development." RedFlag will lead GNOME Foundation efforts in China, focusing on
education, support and marketing. It will also join the volunteer efforts of more than
500 of the world's most talented software designers and programmers who are currently
working on GNOME or GNOME-compatible programs. "We're very committed to the GNOME
Foundation and the localization of GNOME into Simplified Chinese," said Bo Liu,
president and CEO of RedFlag Software Co. Ltd. "GNOME is a robust and powerful
environment that will be very beneficial to individuals, companies and educators here in
China." GNOME is a free software project (also referred to as open source software) that
is developing a complete, easy-to-use desktop for Linux (GNU/Linux), BSD and a variety
of other Unix and Unix-like operating systems. The GNOME desktop is used by millions of
people around the world. More than 500 computer developers, including more than 100
full-time, paid developers, contribute their time and effort to the project.
