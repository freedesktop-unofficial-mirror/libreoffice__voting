      <h3 align="center">Users with Disabilities Get Built-in Assistive Technology Solutions with the GNOME 2.0 Desktop</h3>

<P>
<B>New developments make the GNOME 2.0 Desktop more accessible to the needs
of users with disabilities.</B>

<P>
New York, N.Y. January 28, 2002 - The GNOME Foundation today announced
the latest innovative assistive technology contributions to the GNOME
project, an open-source, free-software desktop for GNU/Linux and UNIX.
BAUM Retec AG delivers the first full-featured GNOME screen magnifier, a
screen reader, and a set of Braille drivers to meet the needs of
vision-impaired users and the Adaptive Technology Resource Centre,
University of Toronto is delivering the first GNOME on-screen keyboard
to support users with motor impairments. These built-in assistive
technologies seamlessly integrate with a new generation of accessible
applications as they enable users with disabilities to easily interact
with applications that can adapt to their needs.

<P>
These new assistive technologies leverage Sun Microsystems, Inc.'s
contribution of the GNOME Accessibility Framework. This framework based
on an open architecture, provides a comprehensive toolkit and APIs, that
developers can use to create accessible applications and interface them
with assistive technologies on any UNIX or GNU/Linux platform running
the GNOME 2.0 desktop. With the combination of the Accessibility
Framework and assistive technologies, users with disabilities have the
solutions they need to get their job done efficiently:


<UL>
 <LI>
Screen Magnifier - enables users with low vision to enlarge the
computer screen and interact with the magnified portion of the screen
they are accessing, such as menus, toolbars, graphics, and text
 </LI>
 <LI>
Screen Reader - allows users who are blind or visually impaired
to access information on the computer screen through a Braille display
or synthesized speech. With screen readers users can read and edit text,
manipulate menu bars, buttons and dialog boxes, and fully interact with
the GNOME desktop
 </LI>
 <LI>
On-screen Keyboard - provides users with physical impairments a
wide variety of ways to enter text and manipulate the graphical user
interface of applications and the GNOME desktop. In addition,
environments without a keyboard, such as a touch screen kiosk, can take
advantage of the on-screen keyboard. This on-screen keyboard goes beyond
the standard physical keyboard, it supports word prediction, scanning
access, coded access, customizable keyboard layouts, and dynamic
keyboard functionality that conveniently places menu bar options and
other application elements onto the keyboard display for direct
manipulation
 </LI>
</UL>
<P>
"Integrating accessibility technology solutions with the GNOME desktop
allows anyone to use GNOME," said Miguel de Icaza, GNOME Foundation
President. These built-in capabilities provide enterprises with a
ready-to-go and comprehensive accessible desktop that adapts to the
needs of users with disabilities. The benefits are vast - for IT
organizations this cost-effective alternative resolves the problem of
buying and installing expensive complex software; for disabled users
it's simpler and more convenient to work and collaborate with team
members since they have the advantage of using any UNIX or GNU/Linux
platform running the GNOME 2.0 desktop".

<P>
"We chose GNOME because of its open, extensible, and comprehensive
accessibility architecture," said Thomas Friehoff, CTO, head of software
development of BAUM Retec AG. "Using the open Assistive Technologies
Service Provider API we were able to deliver our solutions quickly,
because it eliminated the need to reinvent assistive technology software
for different UNIX platforms, saving us time and costs".

<P>
"Our center in Toronto specializes in developing information
technologies that include seamless accessible interfaces," said Jutta
Treviranus, Director, Adaptive Technology Resource Centre, University of
Toronto. "The GNOME Accessibility Framework free software project
enables us to leverage the component-based architecture to develop
technologies that intelligently integrate alternative access techniques.
Using this approach we will make the user interface accessible and
usable by the large group of individuals who cannot use a standard
keyboard or mouse. We will continue working with the GNOME open source
project to develop new kinds of user input support, including an open
source keyboard configuration editor that provides ways to improve the
efficiency of computer interaction for users with disabilities."

<P>
"By providing rich and consistent interfaces for both assistive
technologies and applications, the accessibility framework enables
flexible and comprehensive accessibility solutions for GNOME," said Bill
Haneman, GNOME Accessibility Architect, Sun Microsystems, Inc. "A key
aspect of the GNOME Accessibility Framework is support for user
interface component sets beyond the built-in GNOME component set," said
Peter Korn, Sun Accessibility Architect. "The thousands of applications
that take advantage of the Java Accessibility API will work with the
GNOME Accessibility Framework unaltered and gain the benefit of the
assistive technologies included with the GNOME 2.0 Desktop. In addition,
other important applications, such as the OpenOffice.org productivity
suite, are being modified to use these technologies."

<B>About GNOME</B><BR>
Gnome is a unified, open and rich desktop that employs an intuitive AND
APPEALING USER INTERFACE, includes a wealth of productivity
applications,
SUPPORTS THE LATEST industry STANDARDS, AND PROVIDES AN innovative
component-based architecture, ALL BUILT ON a powerful network-centric
architecture.
GNOME is a free software project (also referred to as open source
software) that is developing a complete, easy to use desktop for
GNU/Linux, BSD and a variety of other UNIX and other operating systems.
The GNOME desktop is used by millions of people around the world. More
than 500 computer developers, including over 100 full-time, paid
developers, contribute their time and effort to the project.
