      <h3 align="center">MandrakeSoft joins the GNOME Foundation</h2>

San Francisco - November 14, 2000 - MandrakeSoft today announced that it is joining the
Advisory Board of the GNOME Foundation, which aims to promote the GNOME graphical
desktop. Linux-Mandrake operating system has included GNOME since early versions and the
GNOME has recently become the desktop of choice for many Linux-Mandrake users.

<br><br>

"We are delighted that MandrakeSoft is joining the Foundation's Advisory Board and
extending its commitment to GNOME ", said Miguel De Icaza, co-founder of GNOME.
"MandrakeSoft's market leadership role in the European Linux market and its strong
retail presence in the US will allow GNOME to reach a much broader audience worldwide."

<br><br>

MandrakeSoft has long recognized the great value offered by the GNOME environment and
its ability to attract new users from the Windows world. MandrakeSoft also credits the
numerous innovations introduced by the GNOME project as one of the key reasons for the
worldwide success of Linux and the Open Source model.

"MandrakeSoft has always been committed to support Free Software and Linux in
particular. Our entrance in the GNOME Foundation proves once again our commitment to
killer free-software projects", said Gaël Duval - VP & Co-Founder of MandrakeSoft.

<br><br>

MandrakeSoft affirms its commitment to the Foundation and to GNOME's bright future by
also announcing to financially sponsor several GNOME developers so that they may focus
on developing GNOME Office/OpenOffice for the benefit of the entire community.

<br><br>

In a related announcement, Borland-Inprise today announced that it, too, will be joining
the GNOME Foundation's Advisory Board.

<b>About GNOME and the GNOME Foundation</b>

<br><br>

The GNOME project has built a completely free and easy-to-use desktop environment, as

for organizations and companies to communicate with the GNOME community and support
GNOME.

Linux and other leading technology companies.
