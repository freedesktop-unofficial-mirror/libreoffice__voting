<br><a NAME="News"></a><b><u>News</u></b>: 1/23/01: <b>Red Flag Linux</b>
</b>joins the GNOME Foundation's Advisory Board. The announcement is <a href="http://news.gnome.org/gnome-news/980366651/index_html">here</a>.
<br>&nbsp;
<p><a NAME="Introduction"></a><b><u>Introduction:</u></b>&nbsp; The GNOME
project has built a complete free and easy-to-use desktop environment for
the user, as well as a powerful application framework for the software
developer. GNOME is part of the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/">GNU project</a>,
and is free software (some times referred to as open source software.)&nbsp;
<p>The GNOME Foundation will work to further the goals of the GNOME project.
<p>To achieve these goals, the Foundation will coordinate releases of GNOME
and determine which projects are part of GNOME. The Foundation will act
as an official voice for the GNOME project, providing a means of communication
with the press and with commercial and noncommercial organizations interested
in GNOME software. The foundation may produce educational materials and
documentation to help the public learn about GNOME software. In addition,
it may sponsor GNOME-related technical conferences, represent GNOME at
relevant conferences sponsored by others, help create technical standards
for the project and promote the use and development of GNOME software.&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p><a NAME="Board of Directors"></a><b><u>Board of Directors</u></b>
<br>The GNOME Foundation is run by a Board of Directors, which was elected
by the entire GNOME community and consists of <u>Miguel de Icaza</u>, <u>Bart

Mena Quintero</u>, <u>Dan Mueth</u>, <u>Havoc Pennington</u>, <u>Maciej

<p><a NAME="Advisory Board"></a><b><u>Advisory Board</u></b>
<br>In addition to the Foundation's Board of Directors, there is also an
Advisory Board, made up of organizations and companies that are supporting
GNOME. The Advisory Board has no decision-making authority but provides
a vehicle for its members to communicate with the Board of Directors. Current
Advisory Board members include <u>Borland</u>, <u>Compaq</u>, <u>Debian
Project</u>,
<u>Eazel</u>, <u>Free Software Foundation</u>, <u>Gnumatic</u>,
