 <a NAME="Introduction"></a><b>Introduction</b>&nbsp; <br>The GNOME
 project has built a complete free and easy-to-use desktop environment for
 the user, as well as a powerful application framework for the software
 developer. GNOME is part of the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/">GNU project</a>,
 and is free software (some times referred to as open source software.)
</p>
<p>
 The GNOME Foundation will work to further the goals of the GNOME project.
</p>
<p>
 To achieve these goals, the Foundation will coordinate releases of GNOME
 and determine which projects are part of GNOME. The Foundation will act
 as an official voice for the GNOME project, providing a means of communication
 with the press and with commercial and noncommercial organizations interested
 in GNOME software. The foundation may produce educational materials and
 documentation to help the public learn about GNOME software. In addition,
 it may sponsor GNOME-related technical conferences, represent GNOME at
 relevant conferences sponsored by others, help create technical standards
 for the project and promote the use and development of GNOME software.
