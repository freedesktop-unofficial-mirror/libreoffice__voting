      <h3>GNOME Foundation Overview</h3>

      <p>
       The GNOME Foundation will work to further the goal of the 
       GNOME project: to create a computing platform for use by 
       the general public that is completely free software.
      </p>

      <p>
       To achieve this goal, the Foundation will coordinate releases 
       of GNOME and determine which projects are part of GNOME. The 
       Foundation will act as an official voice for the GNOME project, 
       providing a means of communication with the press and with 
       commercial and noncommercial organizations interested in GNOME 
       software. The foundation may produce educational materials and 
       documentation to help the public learn about GNOME software. In 
       addition, it may sponsor GNOME-related technical conferences, 
       represent GNOME at relevant conferences sponsored by others, help 
       create technical standards for the project and promote the use and 
       development of GNOME software. For more information, see 
       <A HREF="http://foundation.gnome.org">The GNOME Foundation Web 
       Site</A>.
