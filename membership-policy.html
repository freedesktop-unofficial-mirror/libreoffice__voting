  <h3>Who is eligible for membership in the GNOME Foundation?</h3>

  <p>
   Per the GNOME Foundation's charter, any contributor to GNOME is
   eligible for membership.  Although it is difficult to specify a
   precise definition, a contributor generally must have contributed to a
   non-trivial improvement of the GNOME Project.  Contributions may be
   code, documentation, translations, maintenance of project-wide
   resources, or other non-trivial activities which benefit the GNOME
   Project.  While large amounts of advocacy or bug reporting may qualify
   one as a member, such contributions must be significantly above the
   level expected of an ordinary user.  Membership eligibility is an
   individual determination: while contributions made in the course of
   employment will be considered, they will generally be ascribed to the
   individuals involved, rather than accruing to all employees of a
   "contributing" corporation.  As noted above, these guidelines are not
   meant to define precise objective criteria: ultimately, an
   individual's membership eligibility will be determined on a
   case-by-case basis, in the sound discretion of the Membership
   Committee and the Board of Directors.
  </p>

  <h3>How can I apply for membership in the GNOME Foundation?</h3>

  <p>
   To apply for membership, please complete the form available at <a
   href="http://foundation.gnome.org/membership-form.php">
   http://foundation.gnome.org/membership-form.php</a>.
   Please note that applications for membership must include sufficient
   information to allow the Membership Committee to verify the
   applicants' eligibility; applications which include inaccurate or
   insufficient information may be rejected at the committee's
   discretion.
  </p>

  <h3>My application was rejected; what can I do?</h3>

  <p>
   If you have questions as to why your application was rejected,
   please contact the Membership Committee by electronic mail to <a
   href="mailto:membership@gnome.org">membership@gnome.org</a>; you may
   be able to provide additional information which will lead to the
   approval of your application.  If you are still dissatisfied with the
   Membership Committee's determination, you may appeal the decision to
   the Board of Directors by e-mailing <a
   href="mailto:board@gnome.org">board@gnome.org</a>.
  </p>

  <h3>Renewing your membership</h3>

  <p>
   Membership in the GNOME Foundation ordinarily lasts for two years.
   A reasonable period of time before your membership expires, you will
   be contacted by the Membership Committee with a request that you file
   a renewal application, available <a href="membership-form.php">here</a>.
   Renewal applications will be reviewed according to the
   same standards outlined above for an initial membership, and must
   generally be supported by recent or ongoing contributions to GNOME.
   If you do not file a valid renewal application by the specified
   deadline, your membership will terminate; former members may, of
   course, file a new application for membership at a later date, again
   provided it is supported by recent or ongoing contributions.
  </p>
