<P>Nov 10, 2001</P>
<P><BR></P>
</center>

<P>Below you will find a list of candidates who are running for the
GNOME Foundation Board of Directors. A short summary statement from
each candidate and a link to their full candidacy announcement is
provided to help you learn more about them. We encourage all voters
to read the full candidacy statements and related discussions on
<A HREF="http://mail.gnome.org/archives/foundation-list/">foundation-list@gnome.org</A>.</P>
<P>When deciding who you should vote for, please carefully consider
the various tasks the Board of Directors must perform. This
<a href="overview.html">overview</a> may be helpful. Keep in mind that
the board will make a number of important decisions and will also have
to perform many tasks which require a significant amount of time and
effort and the ability to work and communicate with other people,
companies, and the media. The board of directors will represent GNOME to
companies and the world in a very real way. It is a good idea to strive
for a well-balanced board consisting of people with various backgrounds,
  skills, and perspectives.</P>

<P>1. JONATHAN BLANDFORD
&quot;
I have been involved with GNOME since 1997.  I have spent a lot of time
working on many core parts of GNOME, and feel like I have a very good
idea of how the project works.  I very interested in helping to improve
the desktop experience, I would like to see GNOME spend more time on the
small, incremental improvements that make a desktop usable.

<P>2. CHEMA CELORIO 
&quot;
I have been contributing to GNOME over the past few years, I want to be
on the board because I want to help GNOME even further. I have a very
good relationship with a number of GNOME contributors as well as a very
good understanding of the GNOME community and what drives GNOME forward.
I am confident that we can make GNOME the best desktop available and I
work hard everyday to make it happen.

The future is now, and that future is: Bowling Balls.  Do you realize that
if GNOME starts making bowling balls, we stand to net profit
$11,000?!  That's right, eleven big ones.  Net profit, mind you.

<P>6. NAT FRIEDMAN
&quot;
The foundation could be doing more to help GNOME be more unified,
move faster, and have more visibility.  Things I would like to see
include more focus on the desktop itself, more in-person events
and a coordinated GNOME Office.
I've been contributing to GNOME since 1998 and co-maintained
Bonobo for a while.  I wrote the first draft of the foundation's
charter.  I co-founded Ximian, and these days, I'm in charge of our
product development. &quot;

<P>7. JIM GETTYS
&quot;
I'd like to continue to be on the board to help Gnome reach its potential.
I feel that we are about a year from having the ingredients to make open
source desktops viable for the mass market and would like to do what I
can to help make this happen.  As part of this, I believe interoperability
is a key ingredient, and will work to encourage Gnome to invest in this
area.&quot;

<P>8. JODY GOLDBERG
&quot; 
I have been a free software advocate since the early 90s, and have
contributed to several projects, from G++ and Wine, to Nethack and a
pager for CDE.  As the current maintainer of Gnumeric I'm on the
front lines of what users like and dislike in GNOME.  Our
technologies are good.  Our integration could use some work.  I'd
like to work towards improving communication between the far flung
elements of GNOME to improve that.

20 years, an active Gnome hacker since Dec. 2000. I maintain the Gnome
Accessibility Project (atk, at-spi), co-moderate

the 'Gnome Board hat' I would work hard to take a broad view of what's
best for Gnome.  My hopes for Gnome's future include platform
development/maturation, universal accessibility, interoperability, and
extensibility.

I have been hacking on gnome for over 3 years, and have been involved in language 
binding development, gtk/gnome platform library development and also some work on 
apps.  I am Australian, which may be a good or bad thing, depending on your point 
of view :)  If elected I can represent these interests on the board.  I served on 
the GNOME Steering committee from its creation until the Foundation elections last 
year, where I was one of the unsuccessful candidates.

&quot;
Lots of experience of Gnome both technically and relationally, I
continue to promote Gnome widely at conferences and to companies.
We must finance and encourage small interest group meetings as
well as GUADEC to increase real contact time.
We need to bifurcate the project - the core environment and
the applications built on top of it, so we can release core
improvements more quickly, with a stable API, yet rapidly innovate in
the applications.

I'd like to see the GNOME hackers focus more on the desktop and,
in particular, the user experience now that the GNOME 2.0 platform is almost complete.
I am a co-founder of the GNOME project, and prior to that I was the
maintainer of the GIMP.  I worked at Red Hat Advanced Development Labs

I've presented GNOME to government officials on several continents;
built public awareness of GNOME around the world through the media,
seminars and trade shows; secured funding, hardware and services 
to support GNOME.  I see 2002 as the year GNOME reaches beyond the
hacker community and to schools, corporations and governments.
My contribution is to build bridges, develop strategy, policy and
projects that are inclusive and appeal to a wider geography of
developers and users.

I'm a relative newcomer to the Gnome world as a programmer, with my main 
interests in multimedia, all ease-of-use concerns (accessibility 
included), and portability. I've never run for any elections on such a

politics, and not hackers ;), and being French, I have a big mouth as well.
Hmm, couple of words to go...I like bitter ale.

<P>19. HAVOC PENNINGTON
&quot;
I have several years of experience with GNOME, and want to help ensure
continuity between the current board and the new one. My main goal on
the board is to build up GNOME as a self-sufficient and long-term
organization with solid infrastructure for keeping things running
smoothly. I work on GTK+, GConf, packaging GNOME for Red Hat, and
various less important projects.

<P>20. CHRIS PHELPS
&quot; 
GNOME is the smoothest desktop I've ever used, and I intend to do
anything and everything I can to keep our development rolling. My
personal peeve is that GNOME is an awesome development environment
without a respectable IDE. I intend to work on this to make GNOME more
attractive to all kinds of developers. Yeah, that's about it...

including technical reviews for Gtk+ and GNOME related books. I have been hacking  
in GNOME since the first years of the project. I have attended many conferences  
as a promoter of Free Software and GNOME. My main goal is to seek that GNOME will 
turn into a feasible solution against proprietary software turning into a powerful 
stable API that will be available for everyone.

I've been working for GNOME since years before there was a GNOME.  In
1983, while formulating plans for the GNU operating system, I decided
it should include a window system.  After two desktop initiatives that
didn't pan out, I found Miguel, who launched our third desktop
project--GNOME. As president of the Free Software Foundation and Chief 
GNUisance of the GNU Project, I have had years of experience working with
contributors both individual and corporate.

toolkits on the Internet.  I understand the major
weakness of the GNOME architecture at this stage.  If
I am elected, the first thing I will push is to merge
gnome-specific widgets into gtk+, so there are less
number of libraries to link against :-)

We need to improve the project's outreach, both within the Free Software
community and outside it, through documentation, publicity, and making
good information easy to get to. Some work on infrastructure can make
other tasks and goals easier, such as contributing and releasing. We need
more GNOME love and better cooperation. All of this, openly and
transparently, without interrupting our awesome hacker's hacking time! I'm
wacky enough to believe we can do it, too. :)
